# Automated-Data-Labellng
Zero-shot Object detection using yoloworld

The aim of this project is to develop a system for automating the data labelling process by detecting the mentioned classes in the input vocabulary of uploaded image. The system will utilize image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to accurately identify and detect the mentioned classes containing in the image. The model will be able to plot the bounding boxes over the input classes and save those coordinates. So, instead of training every type of object, it is better that the model itself detects the position of the object by labelling it through proper bounding boxes. This is done with the YOLO World algorithm for object detection.
